# UA Air Raid Alerts
This project was one of the assignments that I completed as part of the Data Visualizations course at Ukrainian Catholic University. The goal of this project was to create an interactive dashboard that displays various statistics and insights about the air raid alerts in Ukraine during russian-Ukrainian war. I used mainly Python Pandas, Numpy and Altair to design and implement the dashboard, which consists of several graphs and charts that allow the user to explore the data by region, time period, and other criteria. The project demonstrates my improved skills and knowledge in data analysis and visualization thanks to this course.
